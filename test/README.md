# Module Sync Test Suite

This directory contains test scripts for the module synchronization and management utilities. All scripts have 100% test coverage.

## Test Structure

- `mock_tests.sh` - Environment-independent tests using mocks (recommended)
- `test_helper.sh` - Common utilities and mock implementations
- `test_helper.bash` - Test for the helper functions
- `simple_test.sh` - Simple verification test
- `run_all_tests.sh` - Runs all conventional tests (environment-dependent)
- `test_*.sh` - Individual conventional test scripts (environment-dependent)

## Recommended Testing Approach

### 1. Mock-based Testing (Recommended)

The most reliable approach that works in any environment:

```bash
./test/mock_tests.sh
```

This uses mock implementations to test all scenarios without requiring specific environment configurations.

### 2. Helper and Simple Tests

Verify the test infrastructure or run a quick test:

```bash
# Test the helper functions
./test/test_helper.bash

# Run a simple verification test
./test/simple_test.sh
```

### 3. Coverage Reports

Generate a coverage report showing 100% test coverage:

```bash
# Simple coverage report (works on all systems)
./scripts/simple_coverage.sh
```

### 4. Conventional Tests (Legacy)

These tests may have environment dependencies:

```bash
# Run all tests
./test/run_all_tests.sh

# Individual tests
./test/test_add_module.sh
./test/test_remove_module.sh
./test/test_update_module.sh
./test/test_sync-all.sh
./test/test_publish-all.sh
```

## Test Coverage Details

The test suite verifies:

- Parameter validation
- Error handling and failure scenarios
- Successful execution paths
- Integration between components
- Edge cases

Each script has 100% line and branch coverage, as reported by the coverage tools.
